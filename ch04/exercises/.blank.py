Many investors see the dollar as a safe place to put their money in times of trouble.
That has helped to drive up its value against other currencies, including the British pound - which hit an all-time low against the dollar on Monday.
Also on Wednesday, the dollar reached a fresh 20-year high against a closely-watched group of leading global currencies.
The yuan's slide is yet another example of a currency weakening as a result of the strong dollar.
